# Detect Behavior From Sensor Data (Helios)
This repository explores time-series classification using multimodal sensor data collected from the Helios wristband, which integrates IMU (motion), ThM (temperature), and ToF (proximity) sensors. The objective is to detect and differentiate body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), such as hair pulling, from everyday non-BFRB gestures, such as adjusting glasses.

Accurately disentangling these behaviors is an important step toward developing reliable wearable BFRB-detection devices, which have direct applications in mental health monitoring and treatment support.

## What is BFRB?
BFRB (Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors) are repetitive self-grooming behaviors such as hair pulling, skin picking, or nail biting, which often lead to physical damage and are difficult to control.
